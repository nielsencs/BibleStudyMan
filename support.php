                <p>Thanks for checking here! This has been and continues to be a
                massive undertaking for me and I could do with all the help I can
                get. Supporting me spiritually by praying that I'd stay on track
                would be wonderful. If you'd be happy to sign up for the monthly
                newsletter (see the tab below) I'll keep in touch with you once
                a month (no more, I promise!) via email to let you know my progress.</p>
                <p>Obviously money is useful too! You can make one off or regular
                donations via PayPal:</p>

                <p>Or there's <a href="https://www.patreon.com/BibleStudyMan">Patreon</a>
                where you can become a Patron with a regular contribution of a
                dollar (or whatever is the equivalent in your currency) each
                month. You can of course go for higher amounts too! To find out
                more or to sign up check out

          <h2>So who is this Bible Study Man anyways?</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Carl Nielsen and I became a believer on
                14th September 1980. Sometime after that I have made a habit of
                reading The Bible over a year each year.</p>
            <p>Several years ago I was diagnosed with clinical depression and in
                my worst days I could not manage to read, but what I had previously
                read was embedded in my heart and some days all I had was "I know
                that my redeemer lives".
                (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+19:25&version=NIVUK">Job 19:25</a>).
                I'm glad to say that depression is largely behind me now, but I
                still have to win a daily victory over that tendency. Because of
                my uncertainty as to what year I started and those
                dark days I cannot be more precise, but I have certainly read The
                Bible from cover-to-cover more than 20 times.</p>
            <p>I am currently a member of the leadership team at
                <a href="http://www.cleanslatechurch.co.uk/">CleanSlate Church</a>,
                Milton Keynes, England where my responsibilities include overseeing
                one of the discipleship programmes, leading the Alpha courses,
                worship and inner healing. I am also a Course Prayer Warrior with
                <a href="https://www.wholenessthroughchrist.org">Wholeness Through Christ</a>
                and previously served as a member of their board of trustees.</p>
            <p>So what? well I do believe that God has shown me by this continuous
                exposure to his word some insights into how to "correctly handle the word of truth"
                (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com%2Fpassage%2F%3Fsearch%3D2%2520Timothy%2B2%3A15%26version%3DNIVUK&sa=D">2 Timothy 2:15</a>).
                I think there can also be a tendency among believers to assume that
                whatever is spoken from the front must be right rather than to test
                it for themselves
                (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com%2Fpassage%2F%3Fsearch%3D1%2BThessalonians%2B5%253A19-22%26version%3DNIVUK&sa=D">1 Thessalonians 5:19-22</a>).
                So let's check what the word of God really says and learn "how
                wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ"
                (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com%2Fpassage%2F%3Fsearch%3DEphesians%2B3%3A18%26version%3DNIVUK&sa=D">Ephesians 3:18</a>)
                for us together!</p>

    <p>Welcome to the <strong>Bible Study Man</strong> website where I
      hope we can learn together what The Bible has to teach us. My aim
      is to bring this <strong>amazing book alive</strong> in a
      <strong>fresh</strong> and <strong>interesting</strong> (sometimes
      <strong>challenging</strong>) way!</p>
    <p>I have divided the site into four key sections detailed below.
      Feel free to explore and if there&rsquo;s anything you can&rsquo;t
      find or understand - get in touch!</p>

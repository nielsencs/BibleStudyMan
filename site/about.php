          <h2>So who is this Bible Study Man anyways?</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Carl Nielsen and I gave my life to The Lord on
                14th September 1980. Sometime after that I began making a habit of
                reading The Bible over a year each year.</p>
            <p>Several years ago I was diagnosed with clinical depression and in
                my worst days I could no longer manage those daily readings, but
                what I had previously read was embedded in my heart and some days
                all I had was "I know that my redeemer lives".
                (<a href="bible.php?book=Job&chapter=19&verses=25">Job 19:25</a>).
                I'm glad to say that depression is largely behind me now, but I
                still have to win a daily victory over that tendency. Because of
                my uncertainty as to what year I started and those dark days I
                cannot be more precise, but I have certainly read The Bible from
                cover-to-cover more than 20 times.</p>
            <p>I am currently a member of the leadership team at
                <a href="http://www.cleanslatechurch.co.uk/" target="_blank">CleanSlate Church</a>,
                Milton Keynes, England where my responsibilities include overseeing
                and teaching one of the discipleship programmes, leading the
                Alpha course, worship and inner healing. I am also a Course Prayer Warrior with
                <a href="http://www.wholenessthroughchrist.org" target="_blank">Wholeness Through Christ</a>
                and previously served as a member of their board of trustees.</p>
            <p>So what? well I do believe that God has shown me by this continuous
                exposure to his word some insights into how to "correctly handle the word of truth"
                (<a href="bible.php?book=2+Timothy&chapter=2&verses=15">2 Timothy 2:15</a>).
                I think there can also be a tendency among believers to assume that
                whatever is spoken from the front must be right rather than to test
                it for themselves
                (<a href="bible.php?book=1+Thessalonians&chapter=5&verses=19-22">1 Thessalonians 5:19-22</a>).
                So let's check what the word of God really says and learn "how
                wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ"
                (<a href="bible.php?book=Ephesians&chapter=3&verses=18">Ephesians 3:18</a>)
                for us together!</p>

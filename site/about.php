          <h2>So who is this Bible Study Man anyways?</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Carl Nielsen and I gave my life to The Lord on
              14th September 1980. Sometime after that I began making a habit of
              reading The Bible over a year each year.</p>
            <p>Several years ago I was diagnosed with clinical depression and in
              my worst days I could no longer manage those daily readings, but
              what I had previously read was embedded in my heart and some days
              all I had was "I know that my redeemer lives".
              (<a href="bible.php?book=Job&chapter=19&verses=25">Job 19:25</a>).
              I'm glad to say that depression is largely behind me now, but until
              recently I still had to win a daily victory over that tendency often
              saying that &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bit like the recovering alcoholic that
              has to avoid alcohol altogether and the equivalent for the depression
              is I have to watch my thought life extremely carefully&rsquo;. That
              has not been my experience for several months now! By the grace of
              God I can honestly say that depression is now no longer a part of
              my life. Because of my uncertainty as to what year I started (and
              those dark days) I cannot be more precise, but I have certainly read
              The Bible from cover-to-cover more than 20 times.</p>
            <p>I have served as an elder in a local church and was until 2019 a member 
              of the leadership team at CleanSlate Church Milton Keynes, England
              where my responsibilities included overseeing and teaching one of
              the discipleship programmes, leading the Alpha courses, worship
              and inner healing. I am also a Prayer Warrior with
              <a href="http://www.wholenessthroughchrist.org" target="_blank">Wholeness Through Christ</a>
              and previously served as a member of their board of trustees.</p>
            <p>So what? well I do believe that God has shown me by this continuous
              exposure to his word some insights into how to "correctly handle the word of truth"
              (<a href="bible.php?book=2+Timothy&chapter=2&verses=15">2 Timothy 2:15</a>).
              I think there can also be a tendency among believers to assume that
              whatever is spoken from the front must be right rather than to test
              it for themselves
              (<a href="bible.php?book=1+Thessalonians&chapter=5&verses=19-22">1 Thessalonians 5:19-22</a>).
              So let's check what the word of God really says and learn "how
              wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ"
              (<a href="bible.php?book=Ephesians&chapter=3&verses=18">Ephesians 3:18</a>)
              for us together!</p>
